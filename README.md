Please find the dataset used as an excel file.

The training set size is [6,019] records and the size of the test set [is] 1,234 records. Following features are given to you to make the prediction:

Name: The brand and model of the car.

Location: The location in which the car is being sold or is available for purchase.

Year: The year or edition of the model.

Kilometers_Driven: The total kilometres driven in the car by the previous owner(s) in KM.

Fuel_Type: The type of fuel used by the car.

Transmission: The type of transmission used by the car.

Owner_Type: Whether the ownership is Firsthand, Second hand or other.

Mileage: The standard mileage offered by the car company in kmpl or km/kg

Engine: The displacement volume of the engine in cc.

Power: The maximum power of the engine in bhp.

Seats: The number of seats in the car.

New_Price: The price of a new car of the same model.

Price: The price of the used car in INR Lakhs.

Steps of Implementation:
1. Data Processing
